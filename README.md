# SQL-for-Data-Engineering

Almost all major tech organizations use SQL. Even Fortune 500 businesses (Facebook, Google, and Amazon) that have created their own high-performance database systems also typically use SQL to query data and conduct analytics.
In fact, approximately 70% of professional developers who work with data (e.g., data engineer, data scientist, data analyst, etc.) use SQL, compared to 61.7% who use Python, making it the third most popular programming language altogether.
 
Why Learn SQL for Data Engineering?
* Learning SQL can help data engineers work more effectively with data analysts and data scientists as they share a common language for querying and analysing data.

* SQL skills are highly transferable as they can be applied to wide range of databases and data management tools, making it a valuable data engineering skill for people working in a variety of industries and business contexts.

* Knowing SQL helps data engineers optimize data infrastructures for better performance and efficiency and also develop more effective data models and data warehousing solutions.
